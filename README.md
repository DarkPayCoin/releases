# SEND COLLATERAL

You will send collateral to yourself, so the coins will remain in your local wallet ; once masternode is enabled, you can put your local wallet offline, your coins will not be exposed to internet and your masternode will work without cointaining any coin.

Click « Send » and enter the address you just created, collateral amount is 10,000 DKPC, then send and confirm




# GETTING YOUR MASTERNODE TX ID

Wait a minute or so, the go back in console and type :

masternode outputs


You will see your collateral transaction id ; please note it as we’ll need it to setup your masternode.
The tx hash and the following number (output_id = 0 or 1) must be noted :



# GETTING YOUR MASTERNODE PRIVATE KEY

In console and type :

masternode genkey


You will see your masternode privkey, note it and never share it !


# MASTERNODE CONFIGURATION (COLD WALLET FILE)

Edit the file masternode.conf file from Tools menu, or manually locate and edit your masternode.conf 
file in the DarkPayCoin directory.


Edit the file to have one-line per MN, be careful to not leave any spaces or tabs after :

MNXXXXX vps_ip_adrr:6667 mn_privkey tx_hash tx_idnothing after last chars 


example :

MN1 4.123.6.66:6667  88frgtsc7zEnaJTeZ7d1D7239Nywaes3gHNZFVJGP6vBQertds 45vghfdcvf68955258364dersbfca18ea871798b516 0

save the file.


# VPS MN CONFIGURATION 

connect your VPS with ssh, get and run the DarkPayCoin MN install script :

rm dpc_mn_install.sh  if you’re updating from previous version
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarkPayCoin/releases/master/dpc_mn_install.sh && chmod +x dpc_mn_install.sh && ./dpc_mn_install.sh 

Answer the script and provide your MN private key (or generate new one and put it in masternode.conf local cold wallet file) to auto-configure .

You can monitor it with :


tail -f ~/.darkpaycoin/debug.log


Once finished you can restart cold wallet .


# MN ACTIVATION FROM COLD WALLET

Your masternode will appear in the list as « MISSING », it is normal.
Wait for at least 10 confirmations of your collateral tx and your wallet has fully synced.
Start your masternode from the UI, or you can also start it in the cold wallet console :

Masternode start-alias 0 MNALIAS


example :


VPS commands :

	systemctl status darkpaycoin.service
	systemctl start darkpaycoin.service
	systemctl stop darkpaycoin.service

In your VPS debug.log file the output show MN is active.
