# HOW TO KNOW IF WALLET SYNC WITH PHASE 2

Latest protocol is 70914. Here are the steps to verify and update your wallets :


CONTROL WALLET

Open dev console ( menu Tools → debug console)
Type command getinfo + enter
Look at protocol version (second line), should be 70914


If wrong protocol, please :

- backup your whole config folder first
- close your control wallet
- download wallet here depending on your OS :
https://github.com/DarkPayCoin/darkpay/releases/
- relaunch and let sync


If you experience chain sync/startup issues :

- backup your whole config folder first
- close your control wallet
- delete everything in your config folder EXCEPT wallet.dat and .conf files
- download sync pack here :
https://darkpaycoin.io/utils/dpc_fastsync.zip
- copy zip content in your config folder (chainstate & block folders + peers.dat)
- relaunch and let sync

if you have block validation error, please launch with  - -resync param


# VPS / MASTERNODE WALLET

Connect to your VPS with SSH (putty, console, ...)
Type command :
darkpaycoin-cli getinfo
Look at protocol version (second line), should be 70914

If wrong protocol :

** During phase 1 there was already an automated masternode setup script. **

* Case 1 : If you used it to install your MN, you just have to run update script running
these commands  in your VPS, and nothing else :

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarkPayCoin/releases/master/dkpc_mn_update.sh 
chmod +x dkpc_mn_update.sh 
./dkpc_mn_update.sh 

Script will stop, update and relaunch your daemon, keeping existing params (ip, privkey, …).

Let it fully finish, be patient, once done a message will remind you to restart your MN from control wallet (right-click → start alias)


* Case 2 : You did not use the install script to setup your MN, so you installed it manually,      so you’re tech savvy enough and you know you just have to stop, replace and relaunch daemon, available here : 
https://github.com/DarkPayCoin/darkpay/releases/download/v3.1.99/DarkPay-3.1.99-LINUX64.zip

* Case 3 : You run your MN on shared or one-click hosting, please see with provider 
support,

* * *

If you experience chain sync/startup issues :

- stop your masternode : ./darkpaycoin-cli stop
- delete everything in your config folder EXCEPT wallet.dat and .conf files
- download sync pack here :
https://darkpaycoin.io/utils/dpc_fastsync.zip
- copy zip content in your config folder (chainstate & block folders + peers.dat)
- relaunch and let sync

if you have block validation error, please launch with  - -resync param :
.darkpaycoind - -resync
